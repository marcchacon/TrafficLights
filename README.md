# NeutronBoardGame
This is a JavaScript code to play a very unknown game called [Neutron](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6978/neutron).
You can play it [here](https://marcchacon.github.io/NeutronBoardGame/)!

Thanks to @danielborowski for creating [jsboard](https://github.com/danielborowski/jsboard)!

## Rules
### Moves
The turn consists in two actions: First you move the Neutron (the middle piece), in any direction and always to the end (occupied space or end of the board). Then move your pieces, following the same pattern.
I know BGG mentions a slightly different rules, but this is how I play with my friends.
### Winning condition
The main game consists on moving the common piece to your space. Your space consists of the initial row your pieces start at. If You can't move the Neutron on your turn, you lose.
### Inverted Game Mode
In this mode, you have to place the Neutron in the other's field! It's a small change, but it changes the perspective of the game.

## 7x7 Board
In this mode, there are two Neutrons, something that can make the game a bit more challenging!
<sub>There's a way that P1 always wins at turn 2
